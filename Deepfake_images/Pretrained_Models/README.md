## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models to detect deepfake images. The models are fine-tuned on a dataset of **140k real and fake faces** collected from Kaggle. The following models have been fine-tuned:

- **VGG16**: Fine-tuned on the last 5 convolutional layers.
- **VGG19**: Fine-tuned on the last 8 convolutional layers.
- **InceptionV3**: Fine-tuned on the last 8 convolutional layers.
- **ResNet50**: Fine-tuned on the last 14 convolutional layers.

The models have been trained, validated, and tested to achieve impressive results in detecting deepfake images. 🎯
